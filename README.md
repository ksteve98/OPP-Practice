# OPP Technique Practice

This repository hosts a single-page study aid for OPP techniques. Open `index.html` locally or push the latest commit to GitHub Pages to make the site live.

## Quick start (local)
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a simple server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`) from the repo root and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages
If your Pages site is already configured to serve from the repository root (or the `main` branch):
1. Commit the updated `index.html` (and any assets) to your branch.
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin <branch>`. Merge to `main` if needed.
3. GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically; refresh the published URL.

If Pages is set to serve from the `docs/` folder instead of the root, move `index.html` (and any supporting files) into `docs/` before pushing.

## Verifying the latest changes
- Open `index.html` and confirm the “Quick orientation” callout and the filter bar at the top of the setup screen. These were added in the most recent update.
- Use the filter box to narrow techniques by name or region; matching counts appear beside the search box.

## Export/import reminders
The app stores your practice stats and notes locally in your browser. Use the **Export Data** and **Import Data** buttons in the header to back up or restore progress when switching devices.
